# Setup KNE

This is part of the How-To guide collection. This guide covers KNE first time
setup on a Linux machine. Specifically the `Ubuntu Focal 20.04 (LTS)` base
image. Modifications may need to be made to the commands listed below in order
to work with your Linux distribution.

The following dependencies and required to use KNE:

* Golang
* Docker
* Kubectl
* Kind
* Make

## Install Golang

1. If golang is already installed then check the version using `go version`. If
   `1.21` or newer then golang installation is complete.

1. Install the new version:

   ```bash
   curl -O https://dl.google.com/go/go1.21.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz
   sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go && sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.21.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz
   rm go1.21.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz
   export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
   export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
   ```

   Consider adding the `export` commands to `~/.bashrc` or similar.

## Install Docker

> NOTE: This will install version `20.10.16` which was known to work with KNE at
> some point in time. You can instead install a newer version if you need new
> features or are having problems.

1. Follow the installation
   [instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository)
   using version string `5:20.10.16~3-0~ubuntu-focal` or the equivalent
   `20.10.16` version for the corresponding OS.

2. Follow the [post-installation
   steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user)
   for Linux. Specifically [manager docker as a non-root
   user](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user).

   ```bash
   sudo groupadd docker
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   ```

## Install kubectl

> NOTE: This will install version `1.27.3` which was known to work with KNE at
> some point in time. You can instead install a newer version if you need new
> features or are having problems.

```bash
curl -LO https://dl.k8s.io/release/v1.27.3/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
```

## Install Kind

> NOTE: This will install version `0.24.0` which was known to work with KNE at
> some point in time. You can instead install a newer version if you need new
> features or are having problems.

```bash
go install sigs.k8s.io/kind@v0.24.0
```

## Clone openconfig/kne GitHub repo

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openconfig/kne.git
```

Install the `kne` binary:

```bash
make install
```

This will build the `kne` binary and move it to `/usr/local/bin` (which should
be in your `$PATH`). Now run:

```bash
kne help
```

To verify that the `kne` is built and accessible from your `$PATH`.
